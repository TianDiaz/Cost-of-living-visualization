Elective 2 - Final Project

This project is for the final requirements needed in our course, Elective 2.

Before running the script, make sure that you've installed 'cost-of-living-datasets.csv'. 
But if you want to run the script with your own CSV file, make sure that the file constains the following columns:
Provinces
Food
Housing
Clothes
Transportation
Personal Care
Entertainment
